# Machine-learning---Python

The aim of this project is to build an application for email classification into "spam" and "ham" (non spam).

The features of emails are extracted based on n-grams algorithm. The two classification methods tested are 
Perceptron and Bayesian classifier.

The accuracy is about 86% for the Perceptron and 74% for the Bayesian 
over a test set of 10 112 emails.

THIS CODE IS WRITTEN IN PYTHON 2.7.10.3 WITH PYCHARM 5.0.3.
